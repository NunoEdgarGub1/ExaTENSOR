2018-03-07: Implement tensor R/W status update (in the cache) at the TAVP-MNG level:
            Dependency check and status update on instruction issue should be done during location cycle;
            Status update on instruction retirement will probably require another rotation cycle, or
            it may be implemented via remote MPI atomics.
2018-03-07: At the bottom TAVP-MNG level it is unclear how to implement replication within a group of the
            TAVP-WRK processes belonging to the same TAVP-MNG process. Perhaps argument renaming and
            replication under modified names provides an acceptable solution:
            T12(a,b,i,j) --> T12$0, T12$1, T12$2, etc. Note that later the output tensor name substitution
            may additionally mangle the name: T12 --> T12#0 (accumulator); T12#1, T12#2, etc. (temporary).
            Thus, combined will give: T12 (original) --> T12$1 (replica) --> T12$1#3 (temporary replica).
2018-03-26: TAL-SH coherence control may not work properly when the same tensor is concurrently participating
            in multiple tensor operations as an input.
2018-03-27: Subspace decomposition algorithm with alignment does not work properly: Example with alignment 5:
            [50] -> [[20]+[30]] -> [[[10]+[10]]+[[25]+[5]]]
2018-04-05: Universal memory allocator may return an error code, but never TRY_LATER. The resource acquisition
            member procedure in tens_resrc_t should somehow separate cases of TRY_LATER:
            mem_allocate() -> tens_resrc_t.allocate_buffer() -> tens_oprnd_t.acquire_rsc() & tens_entry_wrk_t.acquire_resource() ->
            -> tavp_wrk_resourcer_t.acquire_resource().
2018-04-09: It is not clear when to upload and when to destroy a local accumulator tensor: TMP_COUNT never decreases.
2018-04-24: TAVP_INSTR_CTRL_STOP should not be reordered with other instructions in TAVP-WRK:
            It must reach each DSVU the last, that is, each DSVU must pass the STOP instruction as its last instruction.
2018-08-20: get_contr_ptrn_sym() does not accept conjugation bits.
