QFORCE resolution list (D.I.L.):
===============================
UNSOLVED:
 2014/05/12: Add "Deallocation free capability" to the dictionary (reuse of entries memory).
 2014/01/04: Add concurrent kernel execution into tensor_block_contract_dlf_r4_ for input tensor transposes.
 2013/11/24: When more than one process is launched per node, GPUs must be reassigned
             such that only C-processes get them (global and local roots do not require GPU).
             Alternatively, GR and LRs can start using GPUs.
             Alternatively, GPUs can be shared among all processes running on the node.
             Also, QF_GPUS_PER_PROCESS is not used now at all.

SOLVED:
 2014/01/02: gpu_tensor_block_copy_dlf_r4__ kernel does too many divisions/modulo. Solved via tables.
 2013/12/30: No overlap observed between two tensor contractions set to different CUDA streams:
             cudaEventRecord() calls lead to a serialization of the streams execution!
 2013/12/26: Seems like device pointers must be 64-bit aligned in order to get DMA work.
 2013/12/23: cudaHostAlloc() must use cudaHostAllocPortable flag!
 2013/12/19: GPU tensor transpose kernel still uses <int> instead of <size_t> for offsets. Fixed.
 2013/12/19: gpu_tensor_block_contract:
             (a) the inversed destination tensor transpose must have inversed dimension order!
             (b) cudaMemcpyToSymbolAsync will fail for permutations because they have local scope!
                 The permutation must be allocated in the packet and incorporated into tensBlck_t.
 2013/12/04: I need to create a CUDA task pool (cuda_task_create, cuda_task_destroy).
 2013/10/31: Efficient tensor transpose on GPU: Definition of the minor index set:
             (a) Minor input volume >= warpSize; (b) Minor output volume >= warpSize;
             (c) Minor volume <= shared memory buffer size (but as close as possible).
 2013/07/17: If minor index sets differ && the last minor dimension(s) is(are) very long, split it(them).
             Write a short paper on my algorithm for cache-efficient tensor transposes.
 2013/07/16: What should %scalar_value reflect when the tensor rank is higher than zero?
             How to make the %data_real consistent with %data_cmplx8? Complex --> Real conversion done!
